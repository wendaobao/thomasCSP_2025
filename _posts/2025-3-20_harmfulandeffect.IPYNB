    "How do technological innovations impact society in both positive and negative ways? Provide an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: Tech innovations are a double-edged sword. On the plus side, they make communication super easy—think smartphones and the internet connecting us globally. But there's a flip side: privacy issues and social isolation. Social media, for example, lets us share and connect but also spreads misinformation and can mess with mental health. So, while tech makes life better, it comes with its own set of challenges."

    "\n",
    "Answer: Negative effects of technology are the unintended downsides, like privacy breaches, addiction, or misinformation. To tackle these, responsible programming is key. This means writing code with ethics in mind—prioritizing user privacy, creating features that promote well-being, and ensuring transparency. By doing so, we can minimize harm and make tech a force for good."
