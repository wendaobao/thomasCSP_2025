I'll take the side that crowdsourcing isn't always reliable. While it can provide a broad range of insights and data quickly, the quality of contributions can vary.

So, relying solely on crowdsourced data could lead to misinformation or unreliable results.

This diversity can make the playlist more interesting and enjoyable for a wider audience.
