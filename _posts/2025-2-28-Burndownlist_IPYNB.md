## Extra stuff I did: At the N@tm where I interviewed some groups and gave feedback on other groups. Such as the my friends group who worked on creating a multiplayer drawing and guessing game orgnianlly inspired by Scribble.io. I thought this was an interesting website as it was sort of like a game and users could interact and compete for fun with friends.
