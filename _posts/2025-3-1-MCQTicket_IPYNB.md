## **MCQ review Blog
I scored a 58/67, missing only 9 questions. I didn't expect myself to do so good but I still need to improve on some topics such as:
    - Nested Conditionals
    - Developing Algorithms
    - Algorithmic Efficiency
    - Developing Procedures

## Missed Question Review

Question 6: 
![Description](https://i.postimg.cc/HLYJLPHD/Screenshot-2025-03-02-at-9-13-17-PM.png)
Correct Option is C. Program I correctly moves the robot to the gray square by repeatedly moving the robot forward, rotating left, moving forward twice, and rotating right. Program II correctly moves the robot to the gray square by moving the robot forward to the bottom right corner of the grid, rotating left, moving the robot forward to the upper right corner of the grid, rotating left, and moving forward to the gray square.

Question 11:

Correct option is A. The binary numberâ€‡11111111â€‡is equal to 
, or 255. The binary numberâ€‡11110000â€‡is equal to 
, or 240. Therefore, the given binary triplet represents the color ivory.

Question 23:

Correct Option is D. The flowchart setsâ€‡availableâ€‡toâ€‡trueâ€‡wheneverâ€‡weekdayâ€‡isâ€‡trueâ€‡andâ€‡milesâ€‡is less thanâ€‡20, and setsâ€‡availableâ€‡toâ€‡falseâ€‡otherwise. This code statement provides the same functionality.

Question 30:

Correct Answer is D. The stringâ€‡"out of range"â€‡could only be displayed if the conditionâ€‡n â‰¥ 1â€‡wasâ€‡false. If the initial value ofâ€‡nâ€‡is at leastâ€‡0, thenâ€‡nâ€‡will be incremented byâ€‡1, makingâ€‡nâ€‡at leastâ€‡1. Therefore the conditionâ€‡n â‰¥ 1â€‡will beâ€‡trueâ€‡andâ€‡"out of range"â€‡will not be displayed. If the initial value ofâ€‡nâ€‡is negative, thenâ€‡nâ€‡will be multiplied byâ€‡-1, makingâ€‡nâ€‡at leastâ€‡1. Therefore the conditionâ€‡n â‰¥ 1â€‡will beâ€‡trueâ€‡andâ€‡"out of range"â€‡will not be displayed.

Question 37:
![Description](https://i.postimg.cc/J7jGbBxz/Screenshot-2025-03-02-at-9-19-37-PM.png)
Correct Answer is A.The code segment draws four line segments, each with a left endpoint at the coordinateâ€‡(2, 6). The first line segment has a right endpoint at the coordinateâ€‡(8, 8). The loop repeatedly subtracts two from endY, so that the subsequent line segments have their right endpoints atâ€‡(8, 6),â€‡(8, 4), andâ€‡(8, 2).

Question 39:
![Description](https://i.postimg.cc/sxMmN4gq/Screenshot-2025-03-02-at-9-20-39-PM.png)
Correct answer is C. As is, the program does not include the first element of the list in the sum becauseâ€‡iâ€‡is incremented beforeâ€‡num[i]â€‡is added toâ€‡sum. By interchanging these two lines of code, the program will include all of the first ten elements of the list when computing the sum.

Question 50:
![Description](https://i.postimg.cc/D0tzrnNH/Screenshot-2025-03-02-at-9-24-08-PM.png)
Correct answer is D: For an algorithm to run in reasonable time, it must take a number of steps less than or equal to a polynomial function. Algorithm I accesses elements 
 times (twice for each of n elements), which is considered reasonable time. Algorithm II accesses 
 elements (n times for each of n elements), which is considered reasonable time. Algorithm III accesses 10 elements, which is considered reasonable time.

 Question 64:
![Description](https://i.postimg.cc/6Q0LYmtY/Screenshot-2025-03-02-at-9-26-15-PM.png)

C isn't right but D is because:  Sinceâ€‡yâ€‡is initially negative, the loop conditionâ€‡count â‰¥ yâ€‡is initiallyâ€‡true, so the body of the loop is never executed andâ€‡0â€‡is returned.

Future Plan:

 Goal: Improve understanding of how conditionals work within loops and functions.
ðŸ”¹ Review if-elif-else logic with multiple layers.
ðŸ”¹ Practice writing nested conditional functions using real-world problems.
ðŸ”¹ Use Code.org, Replit, or LeetCode for conditionals and debugging practice.


 Goal: Strengthen ability to design and optimize algorithms.
ðŸ”¹ Study Big-O notation basics to understand time complexity.
ðŸ”¹ Break down existing solutions to see how they are structured.
ðŸ”¹ Write pseudocode before coding to improve logical thinking.
ðŸ”¹ Implement and compare different sorting and searching algorithms.
