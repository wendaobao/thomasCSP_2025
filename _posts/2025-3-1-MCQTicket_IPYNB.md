## **MCQ review Blog
I scored a 58/67, missing only 9 questions. I didn't expect myself to do so good but I still need to improve on some topics such as:
    - Nested Conditionals
    - Developing Algorithms
    - Algorithmic Efficiency
    - Developing Procedures

## Missed Question Review

Question 6: 
![Description](https://i.postimg.cc/HLYJLPHD/Screenshot-2025-03-02-at-9-13-17-PM.png)
Correct Option is C. Program I correctly moves the robot to the gray square by repeatedly moving the robot forward, rotating left, moving forward twice, and rotating right. Program II correctly moves the robot to the gray square by moving the robot forward to the bottom right corner of the grid, rotating left, moving the robot forward to the upper right corner of the grid, rotating left, and moving forward to the gray square.

Question 11:

Correct option is A. The binary number 11111111 is equal to 
, or 255. The binary number 11110000 is equal to 
, or 240. Therefore, the given binary triplet represents the color ivory.

Question 23:

Correct Option is D. The flowchart sets available to true whenever weekday is true and miles is less than 20, and sets available to false otherwise. This code statement provides the same functionality.

Question 30:

Correct Answer is D. The string "out of range" could only be displayed if the condition n ≥ 1 was false. If the initial value of n is at least 0, then n will be incremented by 1, making n at least 1. Therefore the condition n ≥ 1 will be true and "out of range" will not be displayed. If the initial value of n is negative, then n will be multiplied by -1, making n at least 1. Therefore the condition n ≥ 1 will be true and "out of range" will not be displayed.

Question 37:

Correct Answer is A.The code segment draws four line segments, each with a left endpoint at the coordinate (2, 6). The first line segment has a right endpoint at the coordinate (8, 8). The loop repeatedly subtracts two from endY, so that the subsequent line segments have their right endpoints at (8, 6), (8, 4), and (8, 2).

Question 39:

Correct answer is C. As is, the program does not include the first element of the list in the sum because i is incremented before num[i] is added to sum. By interchanging these two lines of code, the program will include all of the first ten elements of the list when computing the sum.

Question 50:
![Description](https://i.postimg.cc/D0tzrnNH/Screenshot-2025-03-02-at-9-24-08-PM.png)
Correct answer is D: For an algorithm to run in reasonable time, it must take a number of steps less than or equal to a polynomial function. Algorithm I accesses elements 
 times (twice for each of n elements), which is considered reasonable time. Algorithm II accesses 
 elements (n times for each of n elements), which is considered reasonable time. Algorithm III accesses 10 elements, which is considered reasonable time.

 Question 64:
![Description](https://i.postimg.cc/6Q0LYmtY/Screenshot-2025-03-02-at-9-26-15-PM.png)

C isn't right but D is because:  Since y is initially negative, the loop condition count ≥ y is initially true, so the body of the loop is never executed and 0 is returned.
