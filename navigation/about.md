        <h2>Hello, My name is Thomas and I'am a sophmore at Del Norte High School. I'am interested to take this course and learn about coding and computer science. I enjoy playing video games with my friends. In my free time I like listening to music , my favorite genres is R&B. Adding on to this I play guitar and flute. I also play sports such as swimming and mountain biking although Im not really athletic. In school, my favorite subjects are math and biology. I plan to major in bio-chemistry in college and work in a research lab when I graduate. I'am good at memorization and learning through observations. I hope I can earn a good grade and find my interests after taking this class.</h2>
