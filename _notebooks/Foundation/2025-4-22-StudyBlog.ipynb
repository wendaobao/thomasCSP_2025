    "This blog helps organize all my AP Computer Science Principles lessons. As well as plan on how I will prepare for the exam. First, I will review the lessons throughout the year espcially on topics I felt weak on the practice MCQ. And I will review Collegeboard Videos and practice key topics with flashcards Read the student handbook if its neccesary.
