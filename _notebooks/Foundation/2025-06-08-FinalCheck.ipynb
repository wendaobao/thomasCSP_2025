    "# Favorite Project: MediPulse\n",
    "My favorite project this year has to be MediPulse.\n",
    "This project felt like the perfect combination of challenge and purpose. We were building something beyond for grades, it was about creating something that could actually help people make smarter healthcare decisions. My role in my team focused on frontend designs including artifacts and backend features with API. \n",
    "\n",
    "What made it even more exciting was that this project connected me to a real world opportunity through PilotCity giving us a chance of internship. Although, I won't be able to continuing to develop MediPulse beyond class, adding more features and pushing it even further. I still learned a lot including team collaboration skills as indivdual coding skills. There’s always something more to learn and improve. You’re never really done and that’s what keeps me motivated.\n",

    "\n",
    "Why it stands out:\n",
    "- It challenged me to work across both frontend and backend development.\n",
    "- I had to think about real user needs — this wasn’t just a school project, it had me exposed to potential real-world impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "Building MediPulse showed me how coding can be used to empower people with better information — exactly the kind of problem I want to keep solving in the future.\n",
