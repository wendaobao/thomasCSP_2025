    "Logic gates are used in real-world applications like computer processors, medical devices, automated vehicles, and security systems. For example, in healthcare, logic gates control pacemakers: they decide when to send electrical pulses based on the heart‚Äôs behavior (using conditions like \"if both sensors detect low heartbeat, send a pulse\"). This impact is helpful because it saves lives by ensuring life-supporting devices respond instantly and reliably based on multiple health inputs. In AI and robotics, logic gates help machines make quick decisions by combining different sensor inputs logically, making them smarter and safer."
