    "I feel confident in most areas, especially with topics like Boolean Expressions, Binary Numbers, and Algorithmic Efficiency, where I scored 100%. However, I noticed areas that need improvement—specifically Nested Conditionals (0%) and Lists (60%). I also had lower scores on Mathematical Expressions and Random Values, which suggests I need to review these topics more closely. My goal is to revisit the lessons, practice those weaker areas, and aim for a more consistent understanding across all units before the AP exam.\n",

    "C is correct. Correct. The game piece begins at the rightmost black space. The piece moves one space to the left to a yellow space, and the counter is incremented to 1. The piece then moves three spaces to the left to another yellow space, and the counter is incremented to 2. The piece then moves three spaces to the left to a green space, and the counter is incremented to 3. The piece then moves two spaces to the right to the red space, and the counter is incremented to 4. The algorithm terminates now that the piece is in the red space."
