    "I taught section 3.2.1-3.2.9. Specfically, I created 3.2.5-3.2.9 which included many concepts such as Dictionaries, Sets, Booleans, and None. Also contributed to some of the popcorn hacks. I was able to present my learning to the class and teach them my learnings too. I think this shows that my understanding for my lessons. For memory, in the popcorn hacks I tried to put them steps through steps instead of giving one question that included multiple steps. I also added examples for both python and Javascript in my lessons. I think this would be easier for other people to learn and have a deeper understanding of what they done."

    "### Variables\n",
    "A variable acts as a storage location for data, allowing a programmer to use and manipulate that data easily by referring to the variable name instead of the actual value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Abstraction\n",
    "Data abstraction involves simplifying complex data structures by focusing only on the necessary details while underlying others. This allows programmers to work with data in a more efficient and understandable way, without needing to manage all the details of how the data is processed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mathematical Expressions\n",
    "Mathematical expressions are combinations of numbers, variables, and mathematical operators (such as `+`, `-`, `*`, or `/`) that produce a result when evaluated. In programming, these expressions are used to perform calculations, solve problems, and manipulate numerical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strings\n",
    "A string is a sequence of characters used to represent text in programming. Strings can contain letters, numbers, and symbols, and are often used to store and manipulate textual data like words, sentences, or even entire paragraphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Booleans\n",
    "Booleans represent one of two possible values: `True` or `False`. In programming, boolean values are used to make decisions or control the flow of a program by evaluating conditions or expressions that result in a true or false outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conditionals\n",
    "Conditionals are statements in programming that allow decisions to be made based on whether a certain condition is true or false. If the condition is true, the program executes a specific block of code, and if it is false, the program may execute a different block or skip the execution entirely.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Nested Conditionals\n",
    "Nested conditionals occur when one conditional statement is placed inside another. This allows for more complex decision-making processes, like evaluating multiple conditions. The program will first check the outer condition, and if it is true, it will then evaluate the inner condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Iteration\n",
    "Iteration is the process of repeatedly executing a block of code. This is typically done using loops, which allow a program to repeat a set of instructions a specified number of times or until a certain condition is met.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lists\n",
    "A list is a data structure that stores multiple values in a single variable. Lists can contain any type of data, including numbers, strings, or even other lists. They allow programmers to organize and manage collections of data, making it easier to access, modify, or iterate over the values stored within them."

    "- Accomplishments: I started this unit with little knowledge of Javascript and Python. But through teaching lessons and hearing lessons of others as well as doing practices, I began to understand some of the concepts. This unit was particularly helpful as it combined both teaching and learning experiences, specifically with Python and JavaScript. Engaging with different topics in both languages enriched my understanding of programming concepts. For instance, I noticed how lists and dictionaries in Python are implemented differently compared to arrays and objects in JavaScript. This contrast helped me appreciate the strengths and weaknesses of each language and how they handle data."

For relevancy Pseudocode taught by 3.8 was significant to me in this unit , which allowed me to plan my code logically without getting distracted by syntax errors or programming language specifics.
