       "Emo  is a music genre characterized by emotional, often confessional lyrics. It emerged as a style of hardcore punk and post-hardcore from the mid-1980s Washington, D.C. hardcore scene, where it was known as emotional hardcore or emocore. The bands Rites of Spring and Embrace, among others, pioneered the genre. In the early-to-mid 1990s, emo was adopted and reinvented by alternative rock, indie rock, punk rock, and pop-punk bands, including Sunny Day Real Estate, Jawbreaker, Cap'n Jazz, and Jimmy Eat World. By the mid-1990s, Braid, the Promise Ring, and the Get Up Kids emerged from Midwest emo, and several independent record labels began to specialize in the genre. Meanwhile, screamo, a more aggressive style of emo using screamed vocals, also emerged, pioneered by the San Diego bands Heroin and Antioch Arrow. Screamo achieved mainstream success in the 2000s with bands like Hawthorne Heights, Silverstein, Story of the Year, Thursday, the Used, and Underoath.\n",
       "Often seen as a subculture, emo also signifies a specific relationship between fans and artists and certain aspects of fashion, culture, and behavior. Emo fashion includes skinny jeans, black eyeliner, tight t-shirts with band names, studded belts, and flat, straight, jet-black hair with long bangs. Since the early-to-mid 2000s, fans of emo music who dress like this are referred to as \"emo kids\" or \"emos\". The emo subculture was stereotypically associated with social alienation, sensitivity, misanthropy, introversion, and angst. Purported links to depression, self-harm, and suicide, combined with its rise in popularity in the early 2000s, inspired a backlash against emo, with some bands, including My Chemical Romance and Panic! at the Disco, rejecting the emo label because of the social stigma and controversy surrounding it.\n",
       "Emo and its subgenre emo pop entered mainstream culture in the early 2000s with the success of Jimmy Eat World and Dashboard Confessional, and many artists signed contracts with major record labels. Bands such as My Chemical Romance, AFI, Fall Out Boy, and The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus continued the genre's popularity during the rest of the decade. By the early 2010s, emo's popularity had declined, with some emo bands changing their sound and others disbanding. Meanwhile, however, a mainly underground emo revival emerged, with bands such as the World Is a Beautiful Place & I Am No Longer Afraid to Die and Modern Baseball, some drawing on the sound and aesthetic of 1990s emo. During the late 2010s, a fusion genre called emo rap became mainstream; its most famous artists included Lil Peep, XXXTentacion, and Juice Wrld."

       "The Grammy-nominated rap producer – who has collaborated with Travis Scott, 21 Savage, Drake, The Weeknd and is currently on tour with Future – was raised by a single mother and knew he had to give back in her memory.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Being raised by a single mother myself growing up, I know firsthand how hard things can get,” Metro Boomin told CNN in a recent interview. “My mother dedicated her entire life to being the best mother she possibly could, and I watched her do it all on her own.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Metro Boomin – born Leland Tyler Wayne – had been dedicated to celebrating single mothers and their children prior to losing his mother, whom he commemorated as his “best friend in the universe” on his Instagram back in the summer of 2022. Five years before her passing, he launched his “Single Moms Are Superheroes” initiative. But after he experienced tragedy, the cause became even more personal.\n",

       "He launched a continuation of his program to celebrate single mothers, named after his own mom Leslie Joanne Wayne, in December 2023. Now, “Leslie Joanne Single Moms Are Superheroes” has kicked off a national grant program, in conjunction with Metro Boomin and Future’s North American “We Trust You” tour that will hit 21 cities.\n",

       "The multi-city grant-giving initiative will provide $20,000 grants and show tickets to non-profit organizations supporting single mothers in each city on the tour.\n",

       "“As soon as I got the routing for the tour, I knew that I had to give back and share blessings with the cities and communities who are coming out and sharing blessings with me,” the producer said.\n",
       "\n",
       "“There are thousands and thousands of people in each one of these cities spending their hard-earned money on a ticket to come to the show. I’m more than grateful and don’t take that for granted,” he added. “In return, it means a lot to me knowing that I can support a great cause in each city and leave a positive impact there in a way other than entertainment.”\n",
       "\n",
       "The charity program’s first three stops were at Metro Boomin and Future’s concerts in Kansas City, St. Paul and Detroit last week, where grants were given to the Kansas City non-profit Essential Families, which provides development services for single mothers and families in need; the St. Paul organization Jeremiah Program, which provides assistance to single mothers and children facing poverty; and the Detroit non-profit Alternatives for Girls, which helps young girls and women experiencing homelessness. Both non-profits brought single mothers and their children to enjoy the show.\n",

       "\n",
       "Metro Boomin also said that he recognizes his platform and recognizes his responsibility – and privilege to help others – as a public figure. One of the most in-demand and influential producers working with top artists in the hip-hop space, he also has a massive fanbase with a large reach on social media with roughly 20 million followers across Instagram, X and TikTok.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Giving back is important to me and essential because I know God shines his light on me in a major way,” he says. “And that leaves me responsible to let that light shine through me and onto others.”"
